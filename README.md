# Hot and Cold Guessing Game

## Description of the Project

This game is built with React and Redux.  

## How the Game Works

1. The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100. 
2. The user enters guesses that are recorded until they find the hidden number. 
3. Each time a user guesses, the user receives feedback indicating how close their guess is to the hidden number. 

## Installation

The code uses npm to manage dependencies. Verify that you have the latest version of Node installed. 

1. Download the project, and install the dependencies using 'npm install'.
2. Run `npm run build` before accessing the game. 
3. Use a local server to run the game. You can use your own local server or type  `npm run serve` in the command line. The package comes with [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) already set as a dev dependency. 
4. If you decide to use the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via the `npm run serve` command, you can access the game at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
