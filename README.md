# Hot or Cold Guessing Game

## Description of the Project

This game is built with React and Redux.  

## How the Game Works

1. The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100. 
2. The user enters guesses that are recorded until they find the hidden number. 
3. Each time a user guesses, the user receives feedback indicating how close their guess is to the hidden number.
